//  Label : Labels have Intrinsic size meaning we don't have to give width and height. It automatically sets according to their text.
    
//    AutoLayout Localization error: go to Finder -> locate Main.Storyboard file and its inside base.iproj which is in english language but of you doing in Spanish then it would be like base.iproj.is(suppose) so for that you have to delete Main file from base.iproj and instead just drag to the main folder and then in XCode -> we need to remove the reference and then added back Main storyboard inside project and now error will go away.
